### Associated project

In week 9 begins the Module 3 project, which we do in pairs, and that we named **SplitApp**. The project is a single-page Web application designed for mobile devices using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). We use React for all of the user-facing parts of our application, Express.js for our API back-end that our React app communicates with and Mongoose for models and database communication. The app includes sign up, log in and log out functionalities with encrypted passwords and authorization. You can check the deploy on Heroku [here](https://project3ih.herokuapp.com/login).
